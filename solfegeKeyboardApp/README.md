# solfege-keyboard
This project was born of the contributions of https://github.com/keithwhor/audiosynth and the excellent GUI implementation at http://www.keithwhor.com/music/.

Using moveable Do Solfège, you can select whatever note is Do and the Solfège will automatically adjust to be displayed properly on the keyboard.
